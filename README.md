Project Title: Supervised Learning Model for Detecting Futile Conversations in Task-oriented Conversational Systems.

Author: Mohammad Aldahash, Professor Yuefeng Li , and Associate Prof. Yue Xu.

Description: Breakdown detection is a well-known task in conversational systems, and it refers to when the machine fails to return an appropriate reply to the user. However, a set of breakdown turns between users and machines in task-oriented conversational systems can lead to futile conversations. In this work, the detection not only focuses on the sentence level but it also aims to gain a holistic view of all the turns in conversations. Several ML algorithms are applied to task-oriented conversation data sets (from user's input and machine's output) to detect the futile conversations.

Data set: Data sets are available online: https://dbd-challenge.github.io/dbdc3/datasets.

In this project, we use two pre-trained word representations and they are available online:
1) word2vec (https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).
2) Glov300d (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).


Results are shown in three figures in folder "Results"
